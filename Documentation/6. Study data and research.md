### "Methods and skills for personal organization in first year students of Software Engineering FMAT UADY"

**Definition of personal organization**

Organizing is nothing more than creating a structure that allows us to reach our goals and achieve our objectives, in a systematic way, making the most of the resources we have to do so.


**What is the use of organizing?**

When we have an objective, a goal or a specific task that we want to accomplish, we will have to do a lot of things to achieve it, in the school and future work aspect we will often not be alone, but we will also have a work team, so it is very easy to get distracted among so many things. 
In many cases it will turn out that we will have a whole team, we will have different human, technological and other tools.
 But there will be some moments in which we will be the tool, our knowledge, our attitude and in both cases it will be very important that we apply personal organization techniques, with which we will achieve the effectiveness of our actions and an active and efficient participation, in the process to reach a certain goal.

**Organization methods**

As students, sometimes getting organized and not forgetting to do things seems impossible, however there are actions to be taken and applications that can make your life easier.

- Set realistic goals for each subject at the beginning of each course and actions to implement to achieve them

- Create your own space

- Have an agenda and schedule of physical or digital activities (Google Calendar)

- Review the platform daily to manage the delivery dates of your ADAS in your agenda, or appoint someone from your team to do so, you can also choose to use Moodle.

- Every time you have a task, try to do it as immediately as possible

- If you have team tasks, divide up what each person will do and avoid exhaustive meetings that can steal your time.

- If you have big tasks, divide them into smaller ones and set deadlines, preferably finishing them days before the final delivery 

- Make a list of activities to do per day or week, we recommend Kanban.

- Block tabs that can distract you with Site Blocker (FB, IG, etc.)

**Organizational skills**

We often relate the idea of "being organized" simply to creating a task list in a mobile application. However, there are other elements that are a fundamental part of the success or failure of a good personal organization, and those elements that we are going to talk about today, are nothing more than personal skills, with which surely without them you will not be able to meet your goals and keep an agenda.

Today I would like to present 7 skills that Veronica Fernandez Mesias, consultant and trainer in Management & Planning, considers essential for the organization and daily management:

● Biasing ability
