## How effective is it?

The effectiveness of the technical advice and tools provided will depend on the user, since he will be in charge of using them correctly and without making plots to himself, other factors that can influence the effectiveness are the time it takes to do each task, if it takes more than what is stipulated and that delays other activities, the user could perceive that it does not have a satisfactory result, in those cases, the tasks could be made simpler, or improve the speed of accomplishment of the same ones.

The user should have a strong motivation that drives him to perform those tasks and get organized (regardless of whether those tasks are to his liking or not), so that at the end of the activities, he can get that which he wants, or do that which he likes or some other type of motivation (whether material, practical or emotional).
