# Work process
The SCRUM methodology is used for this project. It is a work methodology that ensures that the team involved knows its tasks and deadlines. It is an agile work methodology that aims to deliver value in short periods of time and is based on three pillars: transparency, inspection and adaptation.

# Product Backlogs
List of all the initial user stories for the product to be developed. Contains a prioritization and a value in story points per user story.
 + Planning Poker: Technique for calculating a consensus-based estimate, mostly used to estimate the relative effort or size of tasks. 

# Sprints
The sprint is the heart of Scrum, it is the container for the other milestones of the process. Everything that happens in an iteration to deliver value is within a sprint. The maximum duration is one month, one week minimum. The time is determined based on the level of complexity of each requirement.

1.  ***Sprint Planning:*** In this meeting the entire Scrum team defines what tasks will be addressed and what the goal of the sprint will be.

 + Capacity table in hours of effort: Determine the team's capacity in hours of effort to perform a task level work during a sprint.
sprint
 + Sprint Backlog: work that is planned to be done during the Sprint, it is a plan that makes visible all the work that the development team identifies as necessary to meet the objective of the Sprint. Also
 
 2. ***Sprint Execution:*** all the work necessary to deliver a potentially deliverable product increment is performed.
 
 + Sprint Execution Planning: plan for how to achieve the sprint goal.
 + Task board: simple but powerful way to communicate the sprint progress at a glance.
 + Sprint progress chart and graph: estimation of how much effort is left for each uncompleted task.
 
2.  ***Deliverables:*** In order for the task to be considered as "Delivered", it must be checked against the conditions set out and see that it complies with each of them, plus the Product Owner must validate it.

3.	***Daily Meeting:*** 15 minutes meeting, led by the Scrum Manager, only the team can intervene: What did you do yesterday, What is the work for today, What do you need? The sprint list is updated.

4.	***Sprint Review:*** The review of the value we are going to deliver to the customer is done in this meeting, at the end of each sprint. In this meeting the Product Owner presents what has been developed to the customer and the development team shows how it works.  The customer validates the changes made and also provides feedback on new tasks that the Product Owner will have to add to the Product backlog.


5.	***Sprint retrospective:*** The retrospective is the last Scrum event and is the team meeting in which an evaluation is made of how the Scrum methodology has been implemented in the last sprint. Scrum Methodology Tools.

# Process Management
Activities are monitored and followed up through the DAILY MEETING. In these meetings, each member explains what has been done, what is missing and what is to be done next. They are also monitored through the JIRA platform, where there is a kanban board, which contains three columns: 
1. TO DO (Those tasks that will have to be done) 
2. IN PROGRESS (Those tasks that are already being carried out) 
3. DONE (Those tasks that have already been completed).

There is also a table of remaining effort hours, in which we can visualize how many hours we need to spend to finish the tasks. This table helps us both to see what we have left to do and we can see if someone is behind, and you can see how many hours a day to work on a task and it is observed that from one day to another has not moved those hours of remaining effort, then it follows that there are problems (delays).

# Quality Control
1. Testing.
