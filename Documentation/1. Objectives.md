**Innovation and creativity**

According to our research it has come to light that most of the young people in our audience do not organize themselves because of forgetfulness and lack of information. Likewise, the resource that university students prefer most when it comes to researching a topic is videos, so we have chosen to make an illustrative video that contains the information from our research about methods and personal organization skills, focused on first year Software Engineering students. Our contribution is considered original since we have collected several relevant techniques and tips that can be specifically implemented by our audience; whether they are skills that should be put into practice, techniques, tips, applications that can make your life easier, with a clear editing that illustrates with images what we want to convey, with transitions, blue and purple color palette and clear voice that describes the organization process
