## ***Bitacora***.
28-NOV-2020: Scrum team meeting (Product owner, scrum master, and development team). The prioritization and estimation of the user stories is carried out. It is agreed that 18 story points can be made per sprint and an approximate estimate is reached that the whole product backlog would be ready in 4 sprint and the use cases are added to each user story. (7 day sprint)
Process: 
 + Prioritization is done by the product owner specifying which user stories he/she wants to develop first to the last and the product owner is in charge of writing the prioritization of each user story using the MosCow method.
 + The estimation is carried out using the planning poker method.
 + The agreement to do 18 story points per sprint came after having the estimation of the user stories, and seeing roughly that the first 3 user stories could be done in a sprint without problem, which gives us a score of 18 user stories per sprint.
    
29-DEC-2020: Sprint 1 begins. Meeting of scrum master and development team to carry out the sprint plannig. Agreement is reached to do the first 3 user stories, the sprint backlog is obtained, the commitment is made with the product owner and the specification of the use cases of the user stories to be developed is done.
Process:
   + Creation of effort hours table: 25-60 hours for the whole sprint. 
   + The division of tasks by user story is done and each task is assigned in hours how long it will take to finish and the total sum of all the hours is done, which gives a total of 27 hours, so it is within the range of the hours of effort we have per sprint.
   + The table becomes our sprint backlog.
   
30-DEC-2020: Start of sprint execution. The scrum master meets with the development team, the analysis of the tools to be used is done and the planning of the sprint execution is done.

   + The sprint planning is what tasks can be done each day, what tasks each developer will do, what tasks can be done in parallel and what tasks need to be done each day to finish in time and form.
